# Angular Sample App

This is an Angular app created via `ng new my-app`.

We've made changes to the following files to make it possible to iterate from a Gitpod Workspace on this sample Angular application:

* .gitpod.yml: defines common tasks
* gitpod.Dockerfile: defines common software needed (like Chrome)
